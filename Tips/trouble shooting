Troubleshooting tidbits
If you've been through the Zero to Mastery TensorFlow for Deep Learning course, you've had plenty of experience troubleshooting different models.

But for reference, here are some of the main issues you might run into (inside and outside of the exam):

Input and output shapes — print these out if you're stuck.
Input and output datatypes — TensorFlow usually prefers float32.
Output activation functions — for classification: sigmoid vs softmax, which one should you use?
Loss functions — for classification sparse_categorical_crossentropy vs categorical_crossentropy, which one should you use?
Ways to improve a model — if your model isn't performing as well as it should, what can you do?
